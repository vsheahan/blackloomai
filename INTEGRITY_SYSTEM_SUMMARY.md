## **API Integration**

Successfully integrated into BlackLoom Defense API with new endpoints:

- `POST /integrity/register` - Register models for monitoring
- `GET /integrity/models` - List all protected models
- `POST /integrity/verify/{model_id}` - Verify model integrity
- `POST /integrity/report` - Generate comprehensive reports
- `GET /integrity/compliance` - Compliance reporting
- `GET /integrity/audit/patterns` - Suspicious pattern analysis

## **OWASP ML Security Coverage**

### **ML05 - Model Theft**
- **Digital signatures** prove model authenticity and ownership
- **Access logging** tracks all model interactions for theft detection
- **Download monitoring** identifies suspicious extraction attempts
- **Pattern analysis** detects model enumeration and bulk access
- **Provenance tracking** establishes clear ownership chains

### **ML10 - Model Poisoning**
- **File-level integrity verification** detects any model modifications
- **Cryptographic hashing** ensures tamper-evident model storage
- **Real-time verification** identifies corrupted or modified models
- **Baseline comparison** detects drift from original model state
- **Comprehensive logging** maintains audit trail of all changes

## üèÜ **Production Readiness**

The integrated system provides:

- **Enterprise-grade security** with RSA-2048 cryptography
- **High-performance verification** with optimized hashing algorithms
- **Scalable architecture** supporting multiple models and users
